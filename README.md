# pegs

I've spent hours with a board of [Peg Solitaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire) years ago. It was so addicting.

This is an attempt to bring it to the browser.

I am using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) and am finding them a great pleasure to use. Building something like this would have been much more difficult if it was not for them.
